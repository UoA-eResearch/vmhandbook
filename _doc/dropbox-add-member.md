### Basic Sharing
Researchers cannot share or change access to the top level Dropbox business folders that we provide. However, researchers can share any file or subfolder within the top level folder with anyone they so wish, and doing so won't count against the storage quota collaborators.

### Sharing Everything
You may wish to share the entire contents of your Dropbox business folder. You cannot share the top level folder, but there is a workaround:

1. On Dropbox, navigate so you are inside your top level Dropbox business folder.
2. Create a folder called, for example, `all data`.
3. Move everything else that is in your top level folder to inside `all data`.
4. `all data` now contains everything, and because it is not the top level folder, you can share it with anyone you want, without it counting against their Dropbox quota.

Structuring your Dropbox folders like this will make sharing all your data with collaborators very simple in the future, and will avoid you needing to make a request to us any time you want to add another person to your Dropbox folder.

### Requesting Access
Access to the top level Dropbox folder that we create for you is controlled by us. This means that if you want to enable access for someone to the topmost level folder itself, you will need to ask us to grant them access, and they will need to have a UPI for us to be able to grant them access. You can request this on the [research hub page for requesting storage](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/#/requestStorage).
