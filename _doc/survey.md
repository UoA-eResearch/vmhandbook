At the end of each year (around November/December), CeR conducts a survey to gather feedback from its users. This feedback is crucial for us to improve our services and better meet your needs. Hereâ€™s how you can participate in the survey:

1. **Check your email**: We will send out an email invitation to all users with a link to the survey. Sometimes these emails may end up in your spam/junk folder, so please check there if you don't see it in your inbox.

![survey invite]({{ "/assets" | append: page.id | append: "/invite.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="1024"}

2. **Complete the survey**: Click on the link in the email and fill out the survey form. The survey typically includes questions about your experience with our services, suggestions for improvement, and any additional comments you may have.

3. **Submit your feedback**: Once you have completed the survey, click the submit button to send us your feedback.

We will send a reminder email if you haven't completed the survey a week before it closes to ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate.

Thank you for helping us improve our services!
