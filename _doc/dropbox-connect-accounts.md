When we give you a Dropbox business folder, the Dropbox account associated with your UoA email will become your work account.
You may wish to connect your personal and work accounts in Dropbox. This makes it easier to move files and folders between the two accounts using your Dropbox desktop client, and enables you to change between accounts without needing to log out then in again.

To connect your accounts, please follow the [official Dropbox instructions found here](https://www.dropbox.com/help/business/connect-personal-account).
Once your accounts are connected, sign in to both accounts on the Dropbox desktop client on your computer. You can now drag and drop items between your personal and business accounts.Your personal folder will still remain personal after connecting the accounts. However, it will be easier to access both your Auckland University and personal accounts on your computer.
