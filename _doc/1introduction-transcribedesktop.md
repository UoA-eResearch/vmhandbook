TranscribeDesktop allows you to transcribe audio and video recordings. It is a "virtual desktop" - a remote computer accessible through your web browser. You can launch the virtual desktop on [Nectar's Virtual Desktop Service](https://desktop.rc.nectar.org.au/login/).

## Tips for Accurate Transcription 

* Ensure the audio input is clear and free of background noise.  
* Enunciate words slowly and clearly, especially technical terms or complex phrases.  
* Review the AI's output and correct any errors or inaccuracies.  
* Provide the AI with context (e.g. the subject matter of the audio) to improve the accuracy of the translation.
* Extended silence in recordings, such as in the beginning or end, may trigger the AI into inaccurately transcribing repetitive phrases in those moments. Consider trimming the silent portions of recordings using a tool like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) before transcribing.
