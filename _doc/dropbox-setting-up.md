Once we have created your Dropbox business folder, you will receive an email (at your UoA email address) inviting you to sign up for a Dropbox business account. This account will provide you with unlimited storage, and access to you Dropbox business folder.

If you donâ€™t already have a Dropbox account using your work email address, respond to the email as instructed, signing in via UoA Single-Sign-On.

If you already have a Dropbox account using your work email address, please change the email on your other account to another address and then proceed as above. For more info, see [Dropbox's instructions on changing your email address](help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/settings-sign-in/change-email for details).
