The University of Auckland nectar onboarding videos are a series of six short videos intended to provide hands-on instruction with the goal of getting a working Windows virtual machine running on University hardware.

In part one we will look at the nectar dashboard and the process of applying for an allocation of resources. For staff and students at the University of Auckland, further guidance for specific needs can be sought by requesting a Virtual Machine consultation through the Research Hub (https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz).
