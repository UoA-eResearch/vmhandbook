## Matlab Images

We offer two images with Matlab pre-installed:
- **UoA-Server2012-MATLAB**: Windows Server 2012, 
- **UoA-Ubuntu1604-MATLAB**: Ubuntu Linux 1604, 

To find these images, login to [Nectar Dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/) via Tuakiri. Browse to *Project > Compute > Images* as shown in the picture below, and enter `Matlab` in the search box. If there are multiple images, please always choose the latest one, and click the "Launch" button to start the new instance wizard.
