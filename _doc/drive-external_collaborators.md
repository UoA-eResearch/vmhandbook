### Instructions for UoA staff member to permit external collaborators to access research drives.

First, follow the steps at [this link](https://superuoa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8183/kw/university%20username%20for%20collaborators) to register a University username and enable network access for the external collaborator.

Once that is done, send a request using the [ResearchHub storage request form](https://eresearch-dashboard.auckland.ac.nz/service/research-storage/request) to enable research drive access for the collaborator. Choose the "Existing" option on the first page.
