We do not give out Dropbox licenses, primarily. Instead, we create Dropbox business folders that are each associated with a particular research project. When we give researchers access to one of these Dropbox business folders, we also give them a Dropbox license at the same time. This license comes with:
- Unlimited storage
- The ability to share anything with collaborators, without it counting against their storage quota (so long as the files shared are located within the Dropbox business folder)
