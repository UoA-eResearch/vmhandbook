For security reasons Windows VMs by default don't have access to the Internet. But all University machines, including VMs, have access to the NeSI lander host, so you can log into the lander host or transfer data to and from NeSI just like you do with your desktop computer or laptop.

Check [this NeSI Support article](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000161315) for details.
