> **What This Means for You:** We're moving your virtual machine to a new cloud platform. Think of it like moving to a new office - same furniture, different building.

## What Will Change

| Item | What to Expect | What You Need to Do |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| IP Address | Your virtual machine will have a new IP address | We will send you the new IP address |
| DNS | The auckland.ac.nz DNS name for the VM will not change | If you have other aliases or records, you will need to update these DNS records manually |
| File backup | All files in the VM will not be backed up anymore | If it is an issue, you can request a Research Drive, which is backed up, to be mounted on the VM. [Link](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/managing-research-data/research-data-storage/research-drive) |

## What Will Stay the Same

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Your Files | All your documents, data, and files remain untouched |
| Software | All your installed programs and settings will be exactly the same |
| Computer Power | Your virtual machine will have the same computing resources |

> **Downtime:** Your virtual machine will be unavailable for 1-2 days during the move. Plan accordingly.
