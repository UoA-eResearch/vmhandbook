## Accessing Local Files and Folders on Remote Desktop Session

To access local files from virtual machines, you need to configure the remote desktop connection settings **before** connecting to the VM.

On Windows, choose your **local resources** in the settings of your remote desktop connection window.  Notice below the **More** button at the bottom which takes you to the local devices and resources section which allows resources to be chosen.
