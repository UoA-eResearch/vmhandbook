You can use globus (globus.org) to transfer data between your research drive and NeSI and other globus endpoints. [See here for documentation](https://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/360000576776-Data-Transfer-using-Globus).  
If you want your research drive accessible as a globus end point, please provide us with the name of your research drive and the UPIs of those on your team who need this access.
