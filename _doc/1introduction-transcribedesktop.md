TranscribeDesktop is a solution that allows you to transcribe your audio and video recordings. It is a "virtual desktop" - a remote computer set up with AI transcription tools that you can use through your web browser. You can launch the virtual desktop on Nectar's Virtual Desktop Service.

This is only available to researchers with access to the Nectar platform. See [here](https://desktop.rc.nectar.org.au/about/) for more information.

## Tips for Accurate Transcription 

* Clear Audio: Ensure the audio input is clear and free of background noise.  
* Speak Slowly and Clearly: Enunciate words, especially technical terms or complex phrases.  
* Verify and Correct: Review the AI's output and correct any errors or inaccuracies.  
* Context is Key: Providing the AI with context (e.g., the subject matter of the audio) can improve the accuracy of the translation.
* Remove Silences: Extended silence in recordings, such as in the beginning or end, may trigger the AI into inaccurately transcribing repetitive phrases in those moments. Consider trimming the silent portions of recordings using a tool like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) before transcribing.
