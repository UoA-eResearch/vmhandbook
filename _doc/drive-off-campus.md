UoA network drives such as Unifiles research drives are protected by the UoA firewall. This means that by default they are not able to be accessed from off campus.
To access your research drive from off campus:

- You need to be connected to the UoA VPN.
- If you are mapping your research drive for the first time, you need to enter your username as `UOA\your_upi_here`.

#### Connecting to the VPN
You can install FortiClient and connect to the VPN by following the instructions here:
